Firstly we split the project into smaller parts for easy manipulation and understanding
AppliElections, AppliReunion and AppliTontine are separate applications of the project (The splited parts of the project ). Which means that we have used divide and rule principle to tackle the solution
We have listed th apps in the settings.py file of the main project in the "installed apps" option
In the 3 apps, we create their separate and individual urls.py for creating views



NB: Any changes made to the project must be listed in this file in a step by step manner
